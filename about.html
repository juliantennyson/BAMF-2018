        <h2 id="whatis">What is BAMF?</h2>
        
    
            <p>After inaugural 2017, BAMF! 2018 is the second annual 24-hour continuous art and music festival in Bellingham, Washington. Our mission as Bellingham Art &amp; Music Festival is to present Bellingham with a confluence of local music, art, activism, business, beer and food in an interactive festival setting to encourage celebration, growth, awareness, and inspire change in our little city. We aim to provide the best musical and entertainment event possible in a way that is representative, diverse, affordable, and accessible. We work with students as well as both young and seasoned professionals to build bridges and instill confidence for success in their creative and career aspirations. We reject the notion of Subdued Excitement and encourage people to bring their whole selves with open minds and hearts to learn, explore, engage, and have fun with their community.</p>

    <h3>General info &amp; Reminders</h3>
    
<p>There is NO LIFEGUARD on site at BAMF! Entering the water is entering at your own risk!<br><br>

Nighttime at BAMF! can get very cold. Please pack layers and blankets for keeping yourself warm! There will be fire pits and a handful of propane space heaters placed around busy parts of the site for your heating needs, but ultimately the Quarry is an outdoor site, so plan accordingly.<br><br>
 
It is likely that if we see rain before BAMF!, the site will be very muddy. Please bring appropriate footwear and a change of socks!<br><br>
 
Our toilets will be a mix of composting and blue goo porta potties. The composting toilets are Quarry property, designed to mix human waste with sawdust to create compost! Please use these where they are available, by the Saloon and Cedar stages.<br><br>
 
The Quarry and BAMF! have a Zero Waste &amp; Leave No Trace policy. Volunteers will be around the campground and near all waste receptacles to help sort trash and teach about proper recycling and compost. To reduce waste, please bring your own utensils and plates/bowls to use for your food, whether bought from a vendor or brought from home. Whatever you bring on site must be packed out when you leave! Keep track of all wrappers, receipts, cigarette butts, etc, and dispose of them properly! Your efforts help keep the Quarry a clean and beautiful space for the people who live there, the animals and organisms who thrive there, and future events to happen there.<br><br>
</p>

<h3>The Quarry</h3>
    
<p>The Lookout Arts Quarry is a collectively owned refurbished rock quarry and restored wetland. Approximately 20 artists came together 10 years ago to purchase the property and have built it up into the glory it is today. With that in mind, we ask all patrons of BAMF! To respect the land. Not just because all Earth is to be treated with kindness, but to show respect to the venue owners who have dedicated so much of their lives to this place’s development. If you see something that doesn’t seem to be part of BAMF!, it probably isn’t, so please don’t touch!
</p>

<h2 id="parkingcamping">Parking and Camping</h2>

<p>Parking at BAMF! is $20 per vehicle. PLEASE DO NOT park on the road or your car will be towed. All parking will begin at 12pm on Saturday, May 12th, when the Box Office opens!<br><br>
 
Save money while being a mindful festival goer with our “clown car” discount! If each of your car seats are full of *people* your parking is FREE. Carpool! Bring your friends! Bring your mom!<br><br>

When parking in the lower lot, be aware that you will have to haul your gear to your campsite up a gravel hill or wait for the shuttle to help you get there. When parking up top near the campground, you’ll be leaving your car in a loop surrounding the campsite, but not camping with your car next to your site. The campsite is in a wooded area or in a small grassy field in front of it called The Prairie. Part of The Prairie is reserved first for disability accommodations. Cars are NOT allowed on The Prairie.

<h2 id="SEAT">SEAT and Safety</h2>

<p>Safety is a priority at BAMF! In response to feedback from 2017, we have created a new team called the Peacekeepers. These folks will be identified with bumble bees on antennas, backpacks, and yellow bumble bee striped baseball caps. <br><br>

The Peacekeepers are a team of volunteers dedicated to violence de-escalation and mediation who are there to be a friendly face in the crowd, whatever the reason. They are down to talk about consent and what that means, how to be nice to all of our neighbors no matter race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity/nationality, legal status,etc, and to generally take care of the crowd by handing out water, earplugs, other goodies, and offering support to whoever needs it. <br><br>

Our Peacekeepers, Security, and several members of our staff, totaling approximately 30 people who will be onsite nearly the entire duration of BAMF!, have been trained in the Lookout Arts Quarry violence de-escalation program S.E.A.T. (Support, Education, and Accountability Team). The purpose of SEAT is to have two on-call members available at all times to respond to instances of ANY kind of violence. Each on-call SEAT member will help to split up the conflict and stay with the afflicted person(s) separately. SEAT’s goal is to work to make sure the survivor, or person(s) most impacted by a grey-area conflict, has what they need in order to feel safe and supported. Our job is to provide non-judgemental support to both sides; mediate, and resolve the conflict for the night. If this means escorting people off the property we are prepared to do that. <br><br>

We have a dedicated team of Peacekeepers and Security trained by SEAT who will be connected to the rest of our staff via radio. How do you find these people? Anybody toting a bumble bee, wearing a green security shirt, or with a radio is a friend. We are here to help, so please don’t be afraid to approach us and ask! Stage managers and sound engineers at each stage will also have radios and are accessible in an emergency as they can call other staff to assist you. <br><br>

All of our radios are also connected to Medical, which is staffed by an on-site EMT, nurses and firefighters of various trainings, and Wilderness First Responders. You will not be judged for the way you choose to enjoy yourself at BAMF! by staff, Medical, Security, or the Peacekeepers. These services are available to everyone at any time or state. The Medical tent is always open for those who need a place to catch their breath, at any time or state. <br><br>

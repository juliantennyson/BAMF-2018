        <h3>Volunteer Descriptions:</h3>
            
            <p class="walltext">Hey there! 

BAMF! would not happen without volunteers. It’s the truth! Here’s the rundown of our volunteer program in 2018: <br><br>

All volunteers receive exclusive access to a reduced price ticket ($14), the purpose of which is to help our small event cover the cost of your presence. If this ticket price is out of reach for you, you are still encouraged to apply as we can always work something out. Volunteers have the ability to rank the kinds of roles they’d be interested in taking on and have the option to work more than one shift if they’d like. Each shift is approximately 4-6 hours. <br><br>
<span class="bold">
Volunteers that work 1 shift receive a reduced price ticket and our endless gratitude! <br><br>

Volunteers that work 2 shifts receive a reduced price ticket, drink tickets (or the under 21 equivalent), and our endless gratitude!<br><br>

Volunteers that work 3 shifts receive receive a reduced price ticket, drink tickets (or the under 21 equivalent), a meal ticket, and our endless gratitude! <br><br></span>

After applying, you’ll be put in contact with our Volunteer Coordinator for scheduling and to work out any other details. Volunteers who do not show up or do not complete all of their shifts will NOT be allowed to volunteer with BAMF! in the future. And they make us very sad :( Don’t make BAMF! sad!<br><br>

THANK YOU for applying to volunteer at BAMF! 2018. Below are descriptions of our available volunteer roles: <br><br>  
            
<span class="bold">Firewatch</span> - The Quarry gets very cold once the sun goes down in early May. Our Firewatch crew would be in charge of safely and responsibly heating up the site with fire pits, propane space heaters, and other means. Must come prepared to be outside and active during all kinds of cold weather--this is a nighttime job!<br><br>

<span class="bold">Zero Waste</span> - Leave No Trace! The Quarry is a beautiful site and deserves to be left even prettier than our staff will find it. If you’re into keeping things green, sign up for this team to pick up trash, sort it, and help others do the same. Shifts available during and after the event. <br><br>

<span class="bold">Stagehand/Sound</span> - Curious how stage managers and sound techs run a stage? Have a little bit of experience with stages or sound and want to help out? We’ll need a few people in shifts throughout the day to help with efficiently loading bands and other performers on and off stage and getting them ready to perform. Shifts available only during the event. Must be able to lift 40lbs unassisted. <br><br>

<span class="bold">Peacekeepers</span> - Help keep our attendees cared for and hold space for those who need it. This crew will be dedicated to crowd welfare; they will hand out water, earplugs, light snacks, generally check up on people throughout the day and night, and be free to talk to anybody who needs a friendly face. Peacekeepers will be trained in de-escalation tactics and take a consent-based approach to interpersonal interactions. Someone not being respectful in the crowd? Our Peacekeepers would be happy to chat with them! If this seems like your jam, rank Peacekeepers first! Shifts available only during the event and REQUIRE a one-hour training in late April. <br><br>

<span class="bold">Info Booth/Greeter</span> - Help attendees find their way around, greet them onto the site and help us set the tone for BAMF! 2018. You’ll be stationary or floating with the job of answering attendee questions or handing out information. Shifts available only during the event and it is strongly preferred these volunteers be available the morning-of for an on-site training. <br><br>

<span class="bold">Parking Attendant</span> - Help set up the parking lot and get attendees parked! Neatly situating all those cars requires a dedicated eye and someone good at following directions. Shifts available before, during, and after the event. Must be able to work outside in varying weather with proper footwear and be active for several hours. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold">Setup/Build</span> - Festivals take a lot of set-up to get ready for hosting hundreds of people. If you have skills in construction or are prepared to be physically active with a willingness to learn, come join us early! Shifts available only before the event. MUST be available before May 12 and able to work outside in varying weather with proper footwear and be active for several hours.  <br><br>

<span class="bold">Teardown/Strike</span> - Festivals take patience and energy to unload after hosting hundreds of people. Are you willing to lend a helping hand to our very tired staff to help us bring the Quarry back to its undisturbed glory? Then this is the job for you! Shifts available only after the event. MUST be available on May 13 and able to work outside in varying weather with proper footwear and be active for several hours. <br><br>
<span class="bold">Artist Relations/Hospitality</span> - Making our artists feel extra special is a big job. These volunteers will be helping our Artist Relations Lead set up backstage areas, greet artists as they arrive, and direct them to their stage. Must be professional, welcoming, and attentive to detail. Shifts available before and during the event. <br><br>

<span class="bold">Security</span> - Monitor the crowd and campground to make sure all patrons are behaving safely and calmly. De-escalate situations and remove patrons from the site if it becomes necessary. Must be able to lift 50lbs unassisted and communicate with our Security Lead should grey areas arise. Shifts available only during the event and REQUIRE a one-hour training in late April. **Some positions are paid, inquire with us!<br><br>

<span class="bold">Medical</span>- Staff the Medical Tent and assist our on-site EMT with any/all instructions or incidents. No medical experience required, as most of our time last year was spent assisting folks with minor sprains or cuts, but if you have certifications or trainings we’d love to have you! Shifts available only during the event. MUST be available to meet with our EMT prior to the event. <br><br>

<span class="bold">Box Office</span> - Greet attendees and help them purchase or locate their Will Call tickets. Must be confident with numbers and willing to follow strict directions from our Box Office Boss. Shifts available before and during event. **Last year, our Box Office was in the shade for most of the day, so please be prepared to be a little chilly!<br><br>
    
<span class="bold"> Accessibility Team </span>- Help people with disabilities move about the Quarry and make sure they have what they need to enjoy the day. Work with our Accessibility Lead to prepare the site and vehicles for people’s arrivals and assist them with various tasks. Shifts available before and during the event. Please come prepared to work in a customer service environment with proper footwear for working on your feet. </p>

            <h3 class="anchor"  id="whattoexpect"> What to Expect</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Expect a fun and responsible experience in a fantastical wonderland known as the Lookout Arts Quarry. We have 6 active stages full of music, stand up and improv comedy, workshops, yoga, flow artists, puppet shows, karaoke, plus an art gallery, art installations, a tea lounge, and more! <br><br>

These activities run at all hours of daylight and starlight. Please arrive well-rested and equipped to take care of yourself for the whole weekend. 

</p>

            <h3 class="anchor"  id="thingstoknow">Things to Know </h3>
            
            <p class="bodytext">The festival will run from Friday, May 31 at 3pm to Sunday, June 2 at 5pm. <br><br>

All biological functions can be handled onsite, from water access to food access to toilets! <br><br>
Water: <br>
Can be found at several spigots around the site. Lit up in blue at night for your convenience. <br><br>
Food:<br>
Food vendors will operate alongside each other and even take the early morning and late night shifts to keep all you dancing fools fueled for the full fest<br><br>
Toilets:<br>
A healthy mix of blue goo and composting toilets can be found all around the site<br>
The composting toilets help the Quarry build up their stores of compostable waste. Do your business, sprinkle some saw dust on top, and voila! You’ve just made the earth a greener place. 
</p>

            
        
            <h3 class="anchor"  id="zerowaste">Zero Waste</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">BAMF! is committed to making small improvements year-after-year to make our festival as green as can be. But we can’t do it without you! Here are some ideas: <br><br>
            </p>
<ul class="bodylist">
<li>Please use the many, many trash cans onsite to sort your recycling, food waste, and trash into the proper receptacle. Bring reusable utensils and dishware. </li>
<li>Pack it in, pack it out: thinking of the Quarry like you would a pristine nature reserve. The Quarriors who reside out here call this place home and worked hard to restore its natural environment. Let’s help them stay true to their goal and pack out everything you pack in.</li>
<li>The devil is in the details: keep track of receipts, earplugs, gum wrappers, and cigarette butts. Pack them out or have a Zero Waste volunteer help you sort them into the right receptacle. </li></ul>

<h3 class="anchor"  id="weather">Weather </h3>

<p class="bodytext">The Northwest can be a fickle beast, so please remember that nighttime will be very cold! Bring layers and blankets to keep yourself swaddled with. 

Bring closed-toed shoes to protect from the elements. Bellingham Arts &amp; Music Festival can quickly become Bellingham Arts &amp; Mud Festival! See our <a href="prep.html#bring">packing list.</a>
</p>

<h3 class="anchor"  id="safety">Safety</h3>

<p class="bodytext">We want to be real with you: the Quarry can be a dangerous place. This section is devoted to the safety services we have ramped up for 2019 and explains a bit more about the Quarry property. </p>

<h3 class="anchor"  id="quarry">The Quarry</h3>

<p class="bodytext">We are so honored to be able to host BAMF! at this incredible venue. Did you know the Lookout Arts Quarry operates all year long? Did you know that people live out here? Did you know most of them are craftspeople and world-renowned circus performers? 
<br>
There’s more than meets the eye on this beautiful site and that includes lots of fully or partially completed projects created by the artists who live there. <strong style="background-color:red">If you see something interesting, but it doesn’t look like it’s part of BAMF!, it probably isn’t! </strong>Please leave the art fixtures and makeshift shelters be. This helps keep the property intact and our patrons safe. 

We are visitors to people’s homes when we come for BAMF! We all like to host courteous guests—pay it forward ☺
